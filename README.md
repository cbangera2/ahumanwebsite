# Human — Personal Website

Welcome to my personal website, a space dedicated to the spirit of human curiosity and creativity in an age defined by AI.

## Why "Human"?

In a world rapidly transformed by artificial intelligence, it's easy to forget what makes us unique. This site is a reflection of the indomitable human spirit—our ability to imagine, to create, to care. AI may accelerate progress, but it’s human curiosity that decides the direction of where we go.

## About
