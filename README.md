## Why "Human"?

AI is everywhere right now — headlines, conversations, and predictions about what it might replace.  
The name *Human.* is a reminder that the point isn’t replacement. It’s partnership.  

AI can accelerate progress, but it’s human imagination and curiosity that give it direction.  
This site reflects that balance: built by me, with help from AI.
